# Eric Hansson

**`Graduate Student`**

Hello there! My name is Eric, and I'm a graduate from Lindenwood University in Computer Science.
I worked as a Lead Intern for Lindenwood's Baseball Data Science Team. During the time at Lindenwood I have 
been a D1 student athlete in Swimming & Diving. The time as an athlete I learned the importance of
time managment, language barriers, and teamwork. I am currently looking for a internship or job in the field of Software Engineering.

- I'm currently working on a website template using React and Express.js.
