Hello there! My name is Eric, and I'm a senior at Lindenwood University studying in Computer Science.
I work as a Lead Itern for Lindenwood's Baseball Data Science Team. During the time at Lindenwood I have 
been a D1 student athlete in Swimming & Diving. During the time as an athlete I learned the importance of
time managment, language barriers, and teamwork. Currently I am looking for internship or a job in the field of Software Engineering.
